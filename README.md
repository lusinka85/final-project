I present to you my final project, which focuses on testing the profile page.

The tests included in the project are based on the Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory design pattern, and include the following steps:

Accessing the home page
Loading the login page
Logging into the login page
Accessing the profile page
Accessing the edit window for the profile page
